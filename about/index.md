<p style="font-size:28px">Howdy y'all! We are a club that satiates the techie you all possess! The Electronics and Robotics Club was born from the two of its parent clubs(guess which? :P), 2017 being the year of christening. We are headed by our Manager, Harsh Mundra and our Institute Secretary, Disip Chaturvedi. We are a part of ITC, or the Institute Technical Council, IIT Bombay's primary technical body. Other than that we have six conveners along with many volunteers.</p>
<p style="font-size:28px">The main function of the club is to organize events like Sessions, Hackathons, GCs, Competitions, Workshops, etc. throughout the year. We also maintain a tutorial database and a blog and we are ALWAYS open for contribuitions.</p>
<p style="font-size:28px">We love people contacting us, so drop us a line on <a href="https://facebook.com/erciitb">Facebook</a>, we'll be waiting!</p>
