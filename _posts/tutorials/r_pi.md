The **Raspberry Pi** (read R-pi) is a series of low-cost, credit card-sized single-board computers. It is just like any other computer and features built in **_Wi-Fi_**,  **_Bluetooth_**. You can connect a keyboard, mouse through USB or Bluetooth and a display monitor through HDMI cable and start using it just like a normal computer.
 
But the real power of Rpi is realized in **embedded systems**. The Raspberry Pi  has the ability to interact with the outside world, and has been used in a wide array of digital maker projects, from **_music machines_** and **_parent detectors_** to **_weather stations_** and **_tweeting birdhouses with infra-red cameras_**.
