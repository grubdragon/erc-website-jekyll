**Why PCB Designing?**

We often come across two scenarios where we need PCB designing.
Sometimes we need to fix a medium/large sized circuit with various
components into a smaller and more compact form. And sometimes we need
to use a specific circuit more number of times. In such cases, making a
Printed Circuit Board of the required circuit is very useful.

Have a look:

**What is Eagle?**

Eagle is a PCB Designing Software where you can use custom libraries for
using a variety of elements, from common Resistors, Capacitors etc to
specific ICs, Microcontrollers. It lets you add the elements you want,
design the circuit and the choose the physical connections the way you
want on your PCB.

**Details Of Commands and usages in making the SCHEMATIC**

There are basically two parts of our development in Eagle. First, the
Schematic, that shows all the connections(but not the way you physically
want on the PCB). Secondly, forming final connections and arranging them
in the final physical way we want.

So, in the session, we decided to make a IC 555 circuit.

### We will go through the following procedure:

1.  Making the Schematic

2.  Designing the physical connections

Let us move on to using the software and its commands.

### 1. Making the Schematic

- **add:** Used to add any component. Type in the command bar on top
- After performing add, lots of components will appear.
  Type keywords to search components. Eg. **RCL** in search box to find
  Resistor, Capacitor, Inductor.(Take US Package for resistor.) (uF ==
  Polarised, nF == ceramic)
- **For NE555N** type:**add** on terminal&gt; search **timer** &gt;
  Find 555. Double click&gt;Paste.
- Note:- Whenever **IC** not found, Google the **.lbr** file for that
  IC and copy paste in Eagle list.
- Use Escape to go back to menu.
- For our 555 circuit, we will take a **5mm LED** for Output
- Type **Supply** in search bar to get 5V and Ground
- **move:** to move a component
- **net:** make connections. Net adds connection and side by side
  makes a file(which denotes that there must be a physical
  connection made for this pair in the second part of our designing)
  too.
- Make end to end connections and use **name command** to name the
  wires/components differently so as to differentiate
  between connections.
- Giving values**:** Use **value** command and then click on component
  to enter value.
- **Smash command:** to move around names.(Disassemble components to
  move individually)
- Search **Pin Head** for Berg Pins!
- **Right click** a component to rotate
- **Delete** command and select the “plus” sign (appearing at centre
  of component on zooming) denoting the component to delete it.
- **Label** command to show the labels.

You are expected to be done with the schematic using these commands.

Now Type **Board** command and click Yes option to go to the next part.

### 2. Making the Physical Connections

-   **Air Line**: denotes a connection that must be made(shows that
    these two points ought to be physically connected).
-   **Tools&gt;Ratnest:**Simplifies air wire connections(because the
    connections change with the physical positions of components and
    so, they can also overlap)
-   **Change package**: helps to change the **type** of component.
-   Note: - If you made wrong connections and want to change a
    component, do it in the schematic file (part 1) and not here.
-   Menu&gt;Autorouter is used to find the possible physical routing by
    eagle’s own algorithm. It will return certain best possibilities,
    based on certain criteria.(Note:- Menu&gt;Autorouter&gt;Uncheck
    Continuous Option while auto routing again). In case of **Single
    Layer PCBs**(we mostly have only single layered ones):Top is
    Not Applicable.
-   We can do manual routing by **Route Command.**
-   **Width** of the connection is given in Inches, around 0.024 inches
    is a preferred width(it shouldn’t be very small because not many
    printing facilities may have that accuracy).
-   Change **track shape** by **Right click**(Avoid using right angles
    because of some
-   **Ripoff** command changes a physical connection back to just an
    air wire.
-   It might be useful to create a common ground/power line around the
    PCB, it sometimes simplifies the complexity of connections.
-   Make sure to Save the file in the same folder as the project.

### To make final output files for Gerbv:

-   File &gt; Cam Processor.
-   File &gt; Open &gt; Job == gerb274x.cam
-   Process Job In bottom

### To see the final files in Gerbv:

-   Open the files with following extensions `.brd, .cmp, .plc, .sol, .stc, .sts`.
-   Using the **text** command, you can write text anywhere. Use it for
    specifying stuff to make circuit connection and component
    placement easier. Add these names for reference by choosing layer
    **tNames** and adding text.
-   Change board size using **move command** and moving the boundaries.
