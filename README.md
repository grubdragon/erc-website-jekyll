# Electronics and Robotics Club IIT Bombay
Here resides the Jekyll code for the ERC@IITB website

The Electronics and Robotics Club is coming up under [STAB, IITB](https://stab-iitb.org/) very soon.
Originally, we were two separate clubs, but redundancy drove us into a merger. Drop us a line, we'll be pleased to hear from you! Cheers!
